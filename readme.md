# Awesome JBoss

A list curating resources and information related to JBoss Middleware. The broad range of products, upstream projects and people involved makes it difficult to structurize this information - stay tuned and be patient, later (or later [or later {or later}]) you'll get a nicely structured information pool on JBoss resources here :)

## Subprojects
### Community/Upstream

(Mapping the community projects to Red Hat's structure from above...)

**Accelerate**

[WildFly](http://wildfly.org) - Formerly called JBoss Application Server. JBoss is now reserved for the offerings supported by Red Hat. Very lightweight Java EE (and JavaScript!) environment, scalable, extensible.

[WildFly Swarm](http://wildfly-swarm.io) - Allows putting services into a single deployable but still Java EE conformant jar. Perfect for microservices. Think of Spring Boot in the JBoss world.

[Arquillian](http://arquillian.org) - Server side testing done right.

[RestEasy](http://resteasy.jboss.org) - Helps creating REST services on WildFly (being container agnostic, though).

[Weld](http://weld.cdi-spec.org) - Java [CDI](http://cdi-spec.org/) implementation, already integrated in WildFly, but check out the [documentation](http://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/latest/en-US/html/environments.html) if you want to use it elsewhere.

[JBoss Tools](http://tools.jboss.org) - Eclipse plugins for JBoss technology. Red Hat support under the name *JBoss Developer Studio*.

[Undertow](http://undertow.io) - is "is a flexible performant web server written in java, providing both blocking and non-blocking APIâ€™s based on NIO". Also the standard webserver in Wildfly.
 
[Nodyn](http://nodyn.io) - Framework allowing running server side JavaScript - bit like a JVM version of Node.js. 

**Integrate**

[JBoss Fuse](http://www.jboss.org/products/fuse/overview/) - The integration component of the broader JBoss middleware stack. Built on Apache Camel, Apache ActiveMQ, Apache CXF and Apache Karaf (as well as integrating fabric8, see all below), Fuse enables you doing integration projects programatically.

[Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org) - A popular JMS implementation (JMS 1.1 in the beginning).

[Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org) - A routing and mediation engine for implementing most of the [enterprise integration patterns](http://www.eaipatterns.com/toc.html). DSLs for many languages as well as XML configuration for routing rules are available.

[Apache CXF](http://cxf.apache.org) - A service creation framework, supporting JAX-WS and JAX-RS. Multi-protocol (e.g. SOAP, XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA) and multi-transport (e.g. HTTP, JMS or JBI).

[Apache ServiceMix](http://servicemix.apache.org) - Post-ESB-era ESB ;) Integrates ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF, Karaf etc.     

[HornetQ](http://hornetq.jboss.org/) - (NB - it's outdated!). Fast and reliable messaging subsystem - got integrated with [Apache MQ Artemis](http://activemq.apache.org/artemis/) - which is considered becoming Apache ActiveMQ' successor version 6.x.

[Teiid](http://teiid.jboss.org) - Data virtualization framework. Common layer across DBMS, file systems, services and enterprise legacy systems.

[ModeShape](http://modeshape.jboss.org) - Distributed, hierarchical, transactional, and consistent data store. Doesn't get the audience it deserves IMHO.


**Automate**

[KIE Group](http://www.kiegroup.org) - The umbrella project for things related to BPM, BAM, BRM and alike tools. Powerful enterprise stuff.

[Drools (BRMS)](http://www.drools.org) - Business Rules engine *and* framework.

[jBPM](http://www.jbpm.org) - A BPM engine *and* framework.

[Opta Planner](http://www.optaplanner.org) - Constraint satisfaction solver. I.e. a planning engine for the enterprise.

(not yet mapped)


[Narayana](http://narayana.io) - Transaction manager, even spans across C++ and Java.

[LiveOak](http://liveoak.io) - Looks like a BaaS to me like [BaasBox](http://www.baasbox.com) or [Apache UserGrid](http://usergrid.apache.org). Not sure why/in which way it serves as a JBoss upstream project.

[AeroGear](https://aerogear.org) - Libraries/server-side components helping you build a platform agnostic infrastructure for mobile applications. Currently supported: Android, iOS, JavaScript, Cordova, Windows. Modules: Push, Security, Sync.

[Keycloak](http://keycloak.jboss.org) - SSO solution (including social auth). Out-of-the box screens, zero-coding setups, session administration etc. Like OpenSSO on steroids. Deployable to an app server, as black box appliance or to OpenShift cartridge/as OpenShift service. Includes the former [PicketLink](http://www.picketlink.org) project. 

[Hawkular](http://www.hawkular.org) - Feature full monitoring and management platform.

[fabric8](http://fabric8.io) - Feature complete open source DevOps Platform, supports Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift. This multi-multi-multi-module stack offers everything from base continuous delivery (incl. Chaos Monkey!) over management (incl. taiga.io! Gerrit! has metrics and is searchable) to communication (Slack!). NB - fabric8 is also a component in the even bigger JBoss Fuse stack.

[apiman](http://www.apiman.io/) - Allows applying runtime policy governance to APIs. Uses cases e.g.: service throttling, centralized security, billing and metrics.

[Errai](http://erraiframework.org) Based on GWT, Errai allows type safe web applications (HTML5) based on Java EE. Shared code between platform and server.

[Jolokia](https://jolokia.org) - HTTP/JSON bridge for remote JMX access. Built into Fuse and WildFly.

### Red Hat
[JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP)](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform) - Basically the licensed and supported WildFly offering from Red Hat.

[JBoss Fuse](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/fuse) - Bundles different upstream projects addressing integration (e.g. Apache Camel) to a complete integration suite.

[JBoss A-MQ](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq) - The supported messaging subsystem offering from Red Hat.

[JBoss Data Virtualization](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/data-virtualization) - Red Hat's complete offering around projects like Teiid.

[JBoss Mobile Application Platform](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/mobile/application-platform) - A backend-as-a-service (BaaS) solution, based on Node.js. Offline sync, authentication, API management - all covered. Formerly known as Feedhenry.

[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com) - Is a solution based on Docker, Kubernetes and other community projects that allows deploying JBoss applications to a PaaS by just committing code changes to e.g. GitHub.
