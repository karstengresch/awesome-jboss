# Awesome JBoss

A list curating resources and information related to JBoss Middleware. The broad range of products, upstream projects and people involved makes it difficult to structurize this information - stay tuned and be patient, later or later you'll get a nicely on stop JBoss resource here :)

## Subprojects
### Community/Upstream

[WildFly](http://wildfly.org) - Formerly called JBoss Application Server, a name now reserved for the offering supported by Red Hat. Very lightweight Java EE (and JavaScript!) environment, scalable, extensible, normally technically a bit ahead of the JBoss AS

[KIE Group](http://www.kiegroup.org) - The umbrella project for things related to BPM, BAM, BRM and alike tools. Powerful enterprise stuff.

[Drools (BRMS)](http://www.drools.org) - Business Rules engine *and* framework.

[jBPM](http://www.jbpm.org) - A BPM engine *and* framework.

[Opta Planner](http://www.optaplanner.org) - Constraint satisfaction solver. I.e. a planning engine for the enterprise.

[Arquillian](http://arquillian.org) - Server side testing done right.

[RestEasy](http://resteasy.jboss.org) - Helps creating REST services on WildFly (being container agnostic, though).

[ModeShape](http://modeshape.jboss.org) - Distributed, hierarchical, transactional, and consistent data store. Doesn't get the audience it deserves IMHO.

[Narayana](http://narayana.io) - Transaction manager, even spans across C++ and Java.

[LiveOak](http://liveoak.io) - Looks like a BaaS to me like [BaasBox](http://www.baasbox.com) or [Apache UserGrid](http://usergrid.apache.org). Not sure why/in which way it serves as a JBoss upstream project.

[Nodyn](http://nodyn.io) - Framework allowing

[WildFly Swarm](http://wildfly-swarm.io) - Allows putting services into a single deployable but still Java EE conformant jar. Perfect for microservices.

[Keycloak](http://keycloak.jboss.org) - SSO solution (including social auth). Out-of-the box screens, zero-coding setups, session administration etc. Like OpenSSO on steroids. Deployable to an app server, as black box appliance or to OpenShift cartridge/as OpenShift service.

[Hawkular](http://www.hawkular.org) - Feature full monitoring and management platform.

[Weld](http://weld.cdi-spec.org) - Java [CDI](http://cdi-spec.org/) implementation, already integrated in WildFly but check out the [documentation](http://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/latest/en-US/html/environments.html) if you want to use it elsewhere.

[Teiid](http://teiid.jboss.org) - Data virtualization framework. Common layer across DBMS, file systems, services and enterprise legacy systems.

[AeroGear](https://aerogear.org) - Libraries/server-side components helping you build a platform agnostic infrastructure for mobile applications. Currently supported: Android, iOS, JavaScript, Cordova, Windows. Modules: Push, Security, Sync.


### Red Hat
[JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP)](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform) - Basically the licensed and supported WildFly offering from Red Hat.
