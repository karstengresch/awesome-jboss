## Subprojects
### Community/Upstream

[WildFly](http://wildfly.org) - Formerly called JBoss Application Server, a name now reserved for the offering supported by Red Hat. Very lightweight Java EE (and JavaScript!) environment, scalable, extensible, normally technically a bit ahead of the JBoss AS

[KIE Group](http://www.kiegroup.org) - The umbrella project for things related to BPM, BAM, BRM and alike tools. Powerful enterprise stuff.

[Drools (BRMS)](http://www.drools.org) - Business Rules engine *and* framework.

[jBPM](http://www.jbpm.org) - A BPM engine *and* framework.

[Opta Planner (Constraint Satisfaction Solver)](http://www.optaplanner.org)

[Arquillian](http://arquillian.org) - Server side testing done right.

[ModeShape](http://modeshape.jboss.org) - Distributed, hierarchical, transactional, and consistent data store. Doesn't get the audience it deserves IMHO.


### Red Hat
[JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP)](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform) - Basically the licensed and supported WildFly offering from Red Hat.
